        <p><strong>Celebrity</strong> is a 2023 Netflix K-drama that dives into the glamorous yet treacherous world of social media influencers, following ordinary woman Seo A-ri as she rapidly rises to fame, exposes its dark secrets, and confronts the envious elites and harsh realities of online life, mixing thriller elements with commentary on fame, rivalry, and the manipulation of public perception. The series uses non-linear storytelling to reveal how A-ri went from poverty to becoming an "e-celeb," exposing the superficiality and ruthlessness behind the curated digital lives, with a strong focus on the competitive culture and scandalous aspects of influencer culture.</p>
